          <div id='description'>New York City is home to an incredible degree of linguistic diversity. Many agencies
within the NYC government offer services in English and Spanish (the most widely spoken
minority language by a large margin), but access to services in smaller language communities is
much more uneven. This is frustrating considering that many “smaller” communities number over
50,000 speakers, which is comparable to the population of many small American cities outright.</br></br>
It is vital to provide information and services in more languages to truly meet the needs of New
Yorkers and start to close these huge service gaps.
Take the electoral system as one example. The city is already expanding its language services beyond
what is mandated by Federal Law, but many logistical shortfalls are leaving the targeted eligible
voters out of the process. This is a longstanding and stubborn problem, which we know thanks to
the election-monitoring of Community-Based Organizations and litigation across the country.</br></br>
