 Language Communities by Census Tract. Overlay of available services to come!

<em>Languages of NYC</em>

This webmap is an extension of a past project called <a href = " at https://github.com/alexresnickny/nyc-nonenglish-speakers">nyc-nonenglish-speakers</a>, which only showed the aggregate of non-English speakers (also known as Low English Proficient individuals) by census tract in the city.

This map allows the user to explore which languages these non-English speakers do speak. This is intended for community organizations and other local groups to use, so they know how to target their community outreach.

In time, I will be adding interactivity to this map, with data on which public services are currently available in the city.

<em>Motivation</em>

I have been really interested in language access issues for a long time, but especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, I have watched lots of Mutual Aid Groups across the city grow in different ways.
In my old neighborhood (Ridgewood, Queens), the local <a href = "https://www.ridgewoodtenantsunion.org/">Mutual Aid Network</a> there offers a lot of services in English and Spanish, but has struggled to make resources available in Polish and Arabic. Then I moved to Astoria mid-pandemic.
<a href = "https://www.astoriamutualaid.com/give-help">The Astoria Mutual Aid Network</a> tries to coordinate translation services in the neighborhood but even this is still a fledgling effort.

<em>Tech Used</em>

Built with: https://atom.io/

<em>Installation</em>

The only packages I used beyond the basic suite in atom were <a href = "https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify">atom-beautify</a> to organize my code, and <a href = "https://atom.io/packages/atom-live-server-plus">atom-live-server-plus</a> to monitor my progress before publishing on github (although there are many commits anyway).

<em>Contribute</em>

I only started on my coding journey a few months ago so I'm still learning a lot (and getting lost a lot of the time)! If you would like to build out this map even more, or use it with your organization, feel free!

<em>Credits</em>

I took a lot of inspiration from my classmates in <a href ="https://github.com/chriswhong">Chris Whong's</a> Intro to Web-Mapping Class at NYU this semester. Inspiration for the Legend is based on <a href="https://github.com/matthewpietrus/MN3-Incentives">Matthiew Pietrus'</a> project here, and I learned how to properly add interactivity and to toggle between layers by learning from <a href="https://github.com/JasonPhillipsGitHub/air-quality-map">Jason Phillips'</a> project.
