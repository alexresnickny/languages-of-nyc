 language communities by census tract

<em>Languages of NYC</em>

This webmap is an extension of a past project located at https://github.com/alexresnickny/nyc-nonenglish-speakers, which only showed the aggregate of non-English speakers (also known as Low English Proficient individuals) by census tract in the city.

This map allows the user to explore which languages these non-English speakers do speak. This is intended for community organizations and other local groups to use, so they know how to target their community outreach.

In time, I will be adding interactivity to this map, with data on which public services are currently available in the city.

<em>Motivation</em>
I have been really interested in language access issues for a long time, but especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, I have watched lots of Mutual Aid Groups across the city grow in different ways.
In my old neighborhood (Ridgewood, Queens), the local Mutual Aid Network there (https://www.ridgewoodtenantsunion.org/) offers a lot of services in English and Spanish, but has struggled to make resources available in Polish and Arabic.
The Astoria Mutual Aid Network tries to coordinate translation services in the neighborhood but even this is still a fledling effort (https://www.astoriamutualaid.com/give-help).

<em>Credits</em>

I took a lot of inspiration from my classmates in <a href ="https://github.com/chriswhong">Chris Whong's</a> Intro to Web-Mapping Class at NYU this semester. Inspiration for the Legend is based on <a href="https://github.com/matthewpietrus/MN3-Incentives">Matthiew Pietrus'</a> project here, and I learned how to properly add interactivity and to toggle between layers by learning from <a href="https://github.com/JasonPhillipsGitHub/air-quality-map">Jason Phillips'</a> project.
